This is **my progress for 1000 days**, I want to motivate myself to be more active in learning programming.

In addition to this, this is a benchmark for the limits of my abilities and achievements for 1000 days. Sounds amazing haha, but I want at least there are new things that I understand later and what problems will arise and their solutions.

When this progress has been successful. I want to thank myself for working hard to make at least 1 progress in 1 day.
